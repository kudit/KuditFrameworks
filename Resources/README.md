# KuditFrameworks

Additional components, simpler, and convenience code for Kudit projects.

Edited on Xcode.  Edited on iPad

v1.0.1 8/8/2022 initial commit
v1.0.2 8/8/2022 fixing compile
v1.0.3 8/9/2022 adding in KuditFrameworks shared libraries and adapting to new Swift and iOS models.  Will not be backwards compatible but should work in Swift Playgrounds.  Still has a lot of legacy code that probably isn't needed and will need to be pruned.  Fixed all compile warnings.
